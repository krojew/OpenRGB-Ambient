OpenRGB plugin for NZXT HUE 2 Ambient Lighting.

NZXT CAM, at the moment, is very buggy. This plugin provides a lighter and more stable alternative:

* no flickering
* support for HDR and SDR
* compensation for NZXT cool white LEDs
* stable 60Hz refresh rate
* shuts LEDs down along with the OS
* less resource usage

Note: currently confirmed to be working on Windows 10, but Windows 11 *should* also work.

Versions older than **2.0.0** should be used with OpenRGB **0.6**, while 2.0.0 or newer should work with
OpenRGB **0.7** or newer.
