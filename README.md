OpenRGB plugin for NZXT HUE 2 Ambient Lighting.

NZXT CAM, at the moment, is very buggy. This plugin provides a lighter and more stable alternative:

* no flickering
* support for HDR and SDR
* compensation for NZXT cool white LEDs
* stable 60Hz refresh rate
* shuts LEDs down along with the OS (note: due to a bug in OpenRGB, this might sometimes not work and OpenRGB needs to be closed manually)
* less resource usage

Note: currently works only on Windows 10.
